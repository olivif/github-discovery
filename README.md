## How it works

You can search for interesting repositories using a language tag.

Based on GitHub's [advanced search](https://help.github.com/articles/searching-repositories/) mechanism, you will receive a list of interesting repositories that might be in need of contributors.

It's still early days for github-discovery. The best way to contribute for now is to file an issue with any ideas you might have on how github-discovery can be improved.

# github-discovery ideas

## What to display after search
* [x] full name 
* [x] url

## What to search on 
* topic (search for topic in name, description or readme)
* size of repo (buckets?)
* number of forks (zero or small? buckets again?)
* include forks (should include forks, a lot of repos fork off and become a lot more successful than the parent)
* created (probably not used as a filter)
* last updated (yes, you only want to include *fresh* repos)
* language (yes) 
* number of stars (buckets again?)

## What to sort on 
* stars
* forks
* last updated

* issues - has_issues + open_issues_count
* number of pull requests merged in
* milestones coming up

* start count
